# Election-Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given me the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.
1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of counties in which votes where cast.
4. Calculate the total number of votes in each county.
5. Calculate the percentage of votes each county out of the total count.
6. Determine the county with highest turnout.
7. Print the Election Results to the Command line
8. Save a written Analysis to a text file.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.11

# Challenge Summary

- The code developed can be reused to to anlze any election. This can be done simply changing the data in the source .csv file or by uploading a different .csv file and changing the filename in the code.
